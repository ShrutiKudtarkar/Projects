        <h2>A brief summary of Sindhutai's journey</h2>
        <h3>Early life</h3>
        <p>
            Sapkal was born on 14 November 1948, in Pimpri Meghe village in Wardha district 
            in the then Central Provinces and Berar of Dominion of India to Abhimanyu Sathe, 
            a cowherder. Being an unwanted child, she was referred to as Chindhi (Marathi for "piece of rag"). 
            Abject poverty, family responsibilities and an early marriage forced her to quit formal education 
            after she successfully passed the fourth standard. Sapkal was married off at age 12 to Shrihari Sapkal, 
            who was 20 years older than her, and moved to Nawargaon village, Seloo in Wardha. The marriage did not 
            last long and at the age of 20, she was left on her own to care for a girl child.
        </p>

        <h3>Early work with Adivasis</h3>
        <p>
            Sindhutai Sapkal later found herself in Chikhaldara, where she started begging for food.
            In the process, she realised that there were many children abandoned by their parents and 
            she adopted them as her own. She had to beg even harder to feed ever the larger family. She 
            decided to become a mother to everyone who came across to her as an orphan. She later gave 
            away her own daughter to the Shrimant Dagdu Sheth Halwai trust of Pune, to eliminate the 
            feeling of partiality between her own child and the adopted children.
            Sapkal fought for the rehabilitation of eighty-four villages. In the course of her agitation, 
            she met Chhedilal Gupta, the then Minister of Forests. He agreed that the villagers should not 
            be displaced before the government had made appropriate arrangements at alternative sites. When 
            Prime Minister Indira Gandhi arrived to inaugurate the tiger project, Sapkal showed her photographs 
            of an Adivasi who had lost his eyes to a wild bear. She is quoted as saying, "I told her that the 
            forest department paid compensation if a cow or a hen was killed by a wild animal, so why not a human 
            being? She immediately ordered compensation."
        </p>

        <h3>Orphanages</h3>
        <p>
            Sapkal devoted herself to orphans. As a result, she was fondly called "Mai", which means "mother". She nurtured 
            over 1,500 orphaned children and through them had a grand family of 382 sons-in-law and 49 daughters-in-law. 
            She has been honoured with more than 700 awards for her work. She used award money to buy land to make a home 
            for orphaned children.
